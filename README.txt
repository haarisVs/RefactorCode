Code is good in terms of code contain the Repository Pattern.

But I believe that bad implementation inside the repository because of business login and their structure also included in the repository. In my opinion repository looks more clean when we use data layer and database operation in it.

For Business logic and its structure use service layer, with controller form request. After the validation it go in to the controller. Controller will call service layer after repository pattern to call database opeartion. Also Observer also define in service layer. conslusion is that project look more clean and understandable. Thanks



Do at least ONE of the following tasks: refactor is mandatory. Write tests is optional, will be good bonus to see it. 
Please do not invest more than 2-4 hours on this.
Upload your results to a Github repo, for easier sharing and reviewing.

Thank you and good luck!
